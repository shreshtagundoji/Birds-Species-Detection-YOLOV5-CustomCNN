Object detection has substantial implications in biodiversity conservation, enabling automated mon- itoring of species in their natural habitats. Our work leverages the NAbirds dataset to train YOLOv8, Custom CNN and ResNet50 models, aiming to improve detection accuracy and processing speed in complex, un- controlled environments. These models were chosen for their robustness and efficiency in handling real-time data, addressing limitations in existing wildlife monitoring systems.
